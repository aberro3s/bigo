Performance measures

Big O scability of code, how much the algorithm slow down?
Steps into a function

O(n) -- Linear Time -- Depends on number of inputs
O(1) -- Constant Time -- Only the first item of the array
Rule Book
1 Worst Case
	Always think in the worst case for pulling data
2 Remove Constant
	Constants are irelevant due to the potential value of n, even if you have an 2n
3 Different terms for inputs
4 Drop Non Dominants
